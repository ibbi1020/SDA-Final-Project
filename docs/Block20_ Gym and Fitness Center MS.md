## **1\. Project Overview**

FitTrack is a comprehensive desktop-based gym management system designed to streamline fitness center operations. The application provides integrated modules for member management, trainer coordination, equipment tracking, access control, and financial operations through a centralized database-driven platform.

The system will implement object-oriented design principles, utilizing JavaFX for the presentation layer and MySQL/Oracle database for persistent data storage. The application targets small to medium-sized fitness centers requiring efficient member tracking, payment processing, and operational oversight.

## **2\. Motivation**

Current gym management practices often rely on manual processes, spreadsheets, or fragmented software solutions. Key industry challenges include:

* Member information scattered across multiple systems  
* Time-consuming check-in procedures and payment tracking  
* Lack of maintenance scheduling and utilization tracking  
* Manual billing processes and missed payment collections  
* Limited insights into member behavior and business performance

Our application will address these challenges by providing an integrated solution that centralizes operations, automates routine tasks, and provides real-time business intelligence.

## **3\. Objectives**

The key objectives of this project are:

* Develop a robust desktop application using Java and JavaFX framework  
* Design and implement a normalized MySQL database schema with referential integrity  
* Create intuitive user interfaces for all stakeholder operations  
* Implement secure member check-in/check-out functionality with attendance tracking  
* Automate membership billing and payment processing workflows

## **4\. Expected Outcomes**

Upon completion, the system will deliver:

* **Complete Desktop Application**: Fully functional gym management system with integrated modules  
* **Database Implementation**: Normalized MySQL database with sample data and CRUD operations  
* **User Interface**: Professional JavaFX-based GUI with responsive design and intuitive navigation  
* **Reporting System**: Automated generation of financial, operational, and member analytics reports

## **5\. Project Scope**

The scope of the project includes:

* **Member Management**: Registration, membership plans, billing, and renewal tracking  
* **Trainer Operations**: Profile management, session scheduling, and performance tracking  
* **Equipment Management**: Inventory tracking, maintenance scheduling, and utilization analytics  
* **Access Control**: Real-time check-in/check-out with occupancy monitoring  
* **Reporting System**: Financial, operational, and member analytics with automated alerts

Limitations of the first version:

* Advanced analytics (AI-based fitness recommendations) will not be included initially.  
* Offline usage will be limited, as the app will primarily depend on internet connectivity.

## **6\. Tools and Technologies**

The development will involve:

* **Frontend**: Java and JavaFX  
* **Backend**: MySQL  
* **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Git and GitHub, MySQL workbench, LucidChart
